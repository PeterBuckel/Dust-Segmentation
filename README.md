# Dust-Segmentation
Labeling and Segmentation of Dust

##  Deep learning based semantic segmentation of dust
VGG-Unet Model 
`model.py`
[Trained Models](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuEsiVyVPmXWdxLB1yQzbU9ucWU)

In our work we also introduced the S-Dust dataset, which is available here: [www.agriscapes-dataset.com](https://agriscapes-dataset.com)

##  GUI Dust Labeling
The developed GUI for dust labeling is based on pyqt.
Simply run `main.py` to start the application.

The application loads images from the "input" folder and saves the corresponding mask to the "output" folder.
